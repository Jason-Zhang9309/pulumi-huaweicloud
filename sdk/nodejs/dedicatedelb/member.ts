/**
 * Manages an ELB member resource within HuaweiCloud.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as pulumi from "@huaweicloudos/pulumi";
 *
 * const config = new pulumi.Config();
 * const elbPoolId = config.requireObject("elbPoolId");
 * const ipv4SubnetId = config.requireObject("ipv4SubnetId");
 * const member1 = new huaweicloud.dedicatedelb.Member("member1", {
 *     address: "192.168.199.23",
 *     protocolPort: 8080,
 *     poolId: elbPoolId,
 *     subnetId: ipv4SubnetId,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ELB member can be imported using the pool ID and member ID separated by a slash, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import huaweicloud:DedicatedElb/member:Member member_1 e0bd694a-abbe-450e-b329-0931fd1cc5eb/4086b0c9-b18c-4d1c-b6b8-4c56c3ad2a9e
 * ```
